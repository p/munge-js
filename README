munge-js
========

Some browsers insist on choking on trailing commas in javascript.

Various tools like js lint and minifiers can detect trailing commas,
yet all of them that I have tried refuse to fix them.

Even js compilers refuse to remove the trailing commas.

Well, this annoyance is trivially (ahem) solvable with regular expressions.

Enter munge-js. It will convert good-looking js to something msie might grok.

Usage
-----

import munge_js

output_js = munge_js.convert(input_js)
